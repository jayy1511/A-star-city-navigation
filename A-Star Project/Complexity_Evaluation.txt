# Complexity Evaluation of A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm's complexity is evaluated in terms of E (number of edges) and V (number of vertices) as follows:

1. Heuristic Calculation:
   - Each heuristic calculation (e.g., Euclidean distance) is O(1).

2. Priority Queue Operations:
   - Each insertion or deletion operation in the priority queue is O(log V).

3. Main Loop:
   - The main loop processes each node once and each edge once.
   - The operations inside the main loop are dominated by the priority queue operations.

4. Path Reconstruction:
   - Path reconstruction involves tracing back through the came_from map, which is O(V) in the worst case.

Overall Time Complexity:
   - O(E + V log V)

- E: Number of edges.
- V: Number of vertices.
